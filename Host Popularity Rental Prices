You’re given a table of rental property searches by users. The table 
consists of search results and outputs host information for searchers. Find 
the minimum, average, maximum rental prices for each host’s popularity 
rating. The host’s popularity rating is defined as below:
    0 reviews: New
    1 to 5 reviews: Rising
    6 to 15 reviews: Trending Up
    16 to 40 reviews: Popular
    more than 40 reviews: Hot

Tip: The `id` column in the table refers to the search ID. You'll need to 
create your own host_id by concating price, room_type, host_since, 
zipcode, and number_of_reviews.

Output host popularity rating and their minimum, average and maximum 
rental prices.
