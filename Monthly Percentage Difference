Given a table of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change 
in revenue. The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage 
change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to 
the end of the year.
The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month forward and can 
be calculated as 
((this month's revenue - last month's revenue) / last month's revenue)*100.
