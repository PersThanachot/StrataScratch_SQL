Find the popularity percentage for each user on Facebook. The popularity percentage is 
defined as the total number of friends the user has divided by the total number of users 
on the platform, then converted into a percentage by multiplying by 100.
Output each user along with their popularity percentage. Order records in ascending 
order by user id.
The 'user1' and 'user2' column are pairs of friends.
