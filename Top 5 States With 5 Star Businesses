Find the top 5 states with the most 5 star businesses. Output the state name along with 
the number of 5-star businesses and order records by the number of 5-star businesses in 
descending order. In case there are ties in the number of businesses, return all the 
unique states. If two states have the same result, sort them in alphabetical order.
