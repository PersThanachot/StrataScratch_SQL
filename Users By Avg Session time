Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference 
between a page_load and page_exit. For simplicity, assume an user has only 1 session 
per day and if there are multiple of the same events in that day, consider only the latest 
page_load and earliest page_exit. Output the user_id and their average session time.

WITH all_user_sessions as (
    SELECT a.user_id, 
           a.timestamp::date AS date,
           min(b.timestamp::TIMESTAMP) - max(a.timestamp::TIMESTAMP) AS session_duration
    FROM facebook_web_log a
    JOIN facebook_web_log b 
    ON a.user_id = b.user_id
    WHERE a.action = 'page_load' 
      AND b.action = 'page_exit' 
      AND b.timestamp > a.timestamp
    GROUP BY 
        a.user_id,
        date)

    avg(session_duration) AS avg_session_duration
